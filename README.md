# MIT-WPU-Official-Power-BI-Dashboard
 I developed a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard for MIT WPU, representing official data and addressing the challenges faced by faculties and
 visitors in accessing information. Through this dashboard, I consolidated publication data from over 500 website pages into a single, easily accessible
 platform, eliminating navigation issues. Additionally, I created a dedicated app within the dashboard, enabling faculties to directly update their data
 using laptops or phones. Furthermore, I incorporated a unique feature for faculties to generate personalized PDF by applying filters to their data with
 a single click. This project revolutionized data representation and enhanced data management efficiency for MIT WPU, providing a user-friendly
 solution for faculty and visitor engagement.In this Project i am representing the Dynamic data of the faculties as well scrapped live from the website.
